    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This research guide focuses on the professional discourse community of family medicine, an interdisciplinary field dedicated to delivering comprehensive and continuous care across all age groups. As a student planning to enter the medical field, my goal is to better understand how communication practices, research genres, and disciplinary values function in real-world family practice. This guide is designed for fellow students, pre-med majors, and early-career professionals looking to explore how family physicians build knowledge, share insights, and address evolving health challenges in communities.</p>
    <p>To enhance accessibility and navigation, this guide is organized into four main sections—each linked through a clear structure to support user interaction on the website.</p>

  <section id="section1">
    <h2>Section 1: Describing the Discourse Community</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p>Family medicine integrates long-term care, health education, and equity-focused advocacy. Communication is essential to its goals of preventive care and community-based healing.</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Common Goals:</strong> Prevention, long-term care, equity, holistic wellness</li>
      <li><strong>Genres:</strong> Journals (<em>Annals of Family Medicine</em>), Conferences (AAFP FMX), Forums (AAFP Connect)</li>
      <li><strong>Major Issues:</strong> Telemedicine, AI, Value-Based Care, Health Equity</li>
      <li><strong>Key Terms:</strong> PCMH, EHR, CME, Continuity of Care, Population Health</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="section2">
    <h2>Section 2: Analyzing Communicative Practices</h2>
    <h3>1. Research Articles</h3>
    <p>Published in journals like <em>Annals of Family Medicine</em>, these follow IMRAD structure and drive evidence-based practice.</p>
    <h3>2. SOAP Notes</h3>
    <p>These concise, structured notes document patient interactions and are essential for team-based care.</p>
    <h3>3. CME Modules</h3>
    <p>Used for licensure and ongoing education, these include case studies, digital learning tools, and assessments.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="section3">
    <h2>Section 3: Researching a Key Question</h2>
    <h3>How is Artificial Intelligence Transforming Clinical Decision-Making in Family Medicine?</h3>
    <p>AI tools such as decision support systems and risk stratification algorithms are reshaping how family physicians deliver care. While they improve efficiency, concerns include bias and loss of patient trust. This research synthesizes perspectives from practitioners and literature to evaluate AI’s benefits and risks.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Launch Text:</strong> Jiang et al. (2017). <em>AI in Healthcare</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Topics Explored:</strong> Bias, workflow integration, ethics, trust, diagnostic accuracy</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="transcripts">
    <h2>Supplementary Materials: Interview Transcripts</h2>
    <p>These interviews provide primary research and support the analyses in Sections 2 and 3.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dr. Matti:</strong> Focus on patient-centered care and SOAP note communication.</li>
      <li><strong>Dr. Jeffrey:</strong> Academic perspective on equity, grant writing, and AI research.</li>
      <li><strong>Dr. Azrial:</strong> Culturally responsive care, outreach, and multilingual education tools.</li>
